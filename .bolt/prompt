For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production. First priority is mobile optimization for page load speed and cross-browser functionality.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist. Do not download the images, only link to them in image tags.

Use any photography you can use to develop the cleanest, sharpest design possible and download files whenever possible. Any photography downloaded will be replaced with licensed  or royalty free images.

Pleae note this website is all Quirk Auto Groups impact on the State of Maine, our customers and our employees. With locations in Augusta, Bangor, Belfast, Portland, Rockland and Rockport we are well positioned to serve a great portion of Maine residents with their automotive needs.

When updating any code please my every attempt to make changes ONLY on the page I am requesting any any files that are included in the code. Any change beyond that context I need you to ask me with suggestions on other pages to consider changing and why.
